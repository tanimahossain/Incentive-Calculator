    <string name="About_Incentive">
        Realizing the significance of problem solvers in the current International job market,
        the Computer Science and Engineering department of Daffodil International University has initiated
        some academic incentives for the promising problem solvers of DIU. As they are already struggling
        to keep going with problem-solving and it consumes most of their time, it’s not always possible to maintain
        both sides with dedication and finally achieve something big. So, we’re going to start a new era where problem
        solvers will get proper support from the department so that they can serve the country with their skills and uphold
        the prestige of our Department and University.\n
